Hi Alex,  

I’ve reviewed the concept of your project, and the implementation looks solid.  

All the basic requirements are met, and there are many good solutions in your project:  
- A clear understanding of server app concepts.  
- Proper command-query separation, as you don’t mix retrieving data with data usage.  
- Excellent variable naming.  
- Well-structured `then/catch` branches.  

To challenge yourself further, you could expand the project and introduce more complex logic. This would push you to your limits, as the main difference between a pet project and an industry-level app lies in size and complexity. At that point, you’ll have the opportunity to apply the more advanced concepts we’ve covered during the course.  

Overall, it’s a solid project — great work! Let’s aim even higher next time!
